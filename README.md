This GitHub repository is a simulation of an intersection traffic light control system designed using Tinkercad. 

The project effectively manages traffic across four directions at a typical intersection, with each direction equipped with its own set of green, yellow, and red lights. 

The code ensures that each set of traffic lights transitions through its cycle in a controlled sequence, providing green light to one direction while other directions are held at red, followed by a brief yellow light as a warning before the light turns red. 

This simulation is ideal for educational purposes, offering a practical example of embedded systems application and traffic management principles, and can serve as a foundation for more complex traffic control systems with enhanced features such as sensor integration and adaptive timing based on real-time traffic data.
